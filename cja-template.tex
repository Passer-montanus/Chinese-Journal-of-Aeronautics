  Low service ability of an airfield area causes frequent air traffic congestion and flight delays at busy airports.
  The airport system calls for capacity and efficiency improvements urgently to relieve the current congested situation.
  In this work, an optimization approach for the collaborative operating modes of multi-runway systems is proposed to balance the demand and capacity.
  Based on the theory of runway capacity envelope, a corresponding optimization model is established by introducing the capacity loss coefficient which objectively reflects the mode switching characteristics.
  Then an elitist non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm is designed combined with the mul-ti-objective optimization theory, Compared with the single runway mode, the combined runway modes bring about a striking optimization effect which results in a 38.1\% reduction in the cost of flight delays and a 46.4\% decrease in the quantity of adjusted flights.
  The approach provided can significantly enhance collaborative operating efficiency of a multi-runway system, and effectively improve air traffic punctuality.

The computation method of unsteady transonic flow based on N-S equations should be best accurate, but to three-dimensional complex problems, it can be achieved only on large computers, and moreover, the results are not ideal sometimes\cite{van2000art}.
A viscous/inviscid interaction method is an applicable one and the computation time can be reduced by two orders.

\begin{instructions}
  (Equations, figures and tables are usually not supposed to appear in this part.)
\end{instructions}



\section{Computation scheme}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Governing equation}

\subsubsection{Principle}

The unsteady full-potential equation written in a body fitted coordinate system is given by
\begin{equation}
  (\rho \bm{J})_\tau + (\rho U \bm{J})_\xi + (\rho V \bm{J})_\eta + (\rho W \bm{J})_\zeta = 0
  \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is density, $U$, $V$, and $W$ are the contravariant velocity components in the $\xi$, $\eta$, and $\zeta$ directions, $\tau$ means time, and $\bm{J}$ is Jacobian.
\cref{eq:1} is solved by the time-accurate approximate factorization algorithm and internal Newton iterations\cite{strunk1979elements}; body conditions and wake conditions are implicit embedded.


\subsection{Generation of grids}

Taking the incompressible potential flow round a cylinder for example, the stream function is
\begin{equation}
  \psi = V_\infty \left( r - \frac{a^2}{r} \right) \sin \theta
\end{equation}
where $a$ is radius, and $v_\infty$ the velocity of free stream. Magnifying its radius to $a + \epsilon$.



\section{Presentation of results}

\subsection{Artwork/Figure}

\begin{instructions}
  A detailed guide on electronic artwork is available on our website:

  \end{quotation}
  You are urged to visit this site; some excerpts from the detailed information are given here.

  \paragraph{Formats}
  Regardless of the application used, when your electronic artwork is finalised, please ``save as'' or convert the images to one of the following formats
  (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below):
  \begin{description}
    \item[PDF] Vector drawings. Embed the font or save the text as ``graphics''.
    \item[PNG] color or grayscale photographs (halftones): always use a minimum of 300 dpi.
    \item[PNG] Bitmapped line drawings: use a minimum of 1000 dpi.
    \item[PNG] Combinations bitmapped line/half-tone(color or grayscale): a minimum of 500 dpi is required.
  \end{description}

  If your electronic artwork is created in a Microsoft Office application (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply ``as is''.

  Please do not:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Supply files that are optimised for screen use(like GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG); the resolution is too low;
    \item Supply files that are too low in resolution;
    \item Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content.
  \end{itemize}

  \paragraph{Color artwork}
  Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (PDF, PNG or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution.
  If, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color on the Web (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites) regardless of whether or not these illustrations are reproduced in color in the printed version.
